# 零基础自学计算化学 Self-teaching computational chemistry from scratch
这个库包含一些基本的代码示例，如函数定义（def）、for循环、条件判断等，希望能帮助无计算机基础的初学者（比如像我一样的自然科学专业的毕业生）入门计算化学。
This repository contains basic code examples—such as function definitions (def), for loops, conditions, and other foundational constructs—designed to help learners with zero computer skills (natural science workers like me) get started with computational chemistry.
这些代码也是我在零基础自学的过程中整理的一些内容，如果你想讨论或有任何反馈，欢迎随时与我联系！
Here are some materials I've compiled during my self-study journey. Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to discuss or offer any feedback—I'm always open to suggestions!
